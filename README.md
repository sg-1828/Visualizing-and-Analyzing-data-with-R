# Visualizing-and-Analyzing-data-with-R

The United States has resettled more than 600,000 refugees from 60 different countries since 2006.

In this project, we will use R, ggplot to explore where these refugees have come from.

Here’s what you will see in this project:

Using the Department of Homeland Security’s annual count of people granted refugee status between 2006-2015:

We create a R Markdown file (attached as pdf)

Cleaning the data

Summarize the data somehow. There is data for 60 countries over 10 years, so we’ll probably need to aggregate or reshape the data somehow (unless we do a 60-country sparkline).

We create an appropriate time-based visualization based on the data. We shouldn't just calculate overall averages or totals per country as the visualization needs to deal with change over time. We need to do as much polishing and refining in R—make adjustments to the colors, scales, labels, grid lines, and even fonts, etc.
